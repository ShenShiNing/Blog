## What are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that run exclusively on the server. Unlike traditional components, they don't get shipped to the client, which means:

- Smaller bundle sizes
- Access to server-only resources (databases, file systems)
- No client-side JavaScript for these components

## Using Server Components in Next.js 13

Next.js 13 introduced the App Router, which uses React Server Components by default. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
// app/page.tsx - This is a Server Component by default
async function BlogPage() {
  // This data fetching happens on the server
  const posts = await fetchBlogPosts();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
      <div className="posts-grid">
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <BlogPostCard key={post.id} post={post} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}

export default BlogPage;
```

## Client Components

When you need interactivity, you can use Client Components by adding the "use client" directive at the top of your file:

```jsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

function LikeButton({ postId }) {
  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>
      {liked ? "‚ù§Ô∏è Liked" : "ü§ç Like"}
    </button>
  );
}

export default LikeButton;
```

## Performance Benefits

Server Components can significantly improve application performance by:

1. Reducing the amount of JavaScript sent to the client
2. Moving data fetching to the server
3. Eliminating waterfall requests

## Conclusion

React Server Components in Next.js 13 provide a powerful way to build performant web applications. By thoughtfully dividing your application into server and client components, you can create experiences that are both interactive and fast-loading.
